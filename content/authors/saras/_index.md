I'm a Research Fellow in the [Quantitative and Applied Ecology Group](https://qaeco.com/) at the University of Melbourne. At the moment I work on developing and operationalising statistical models for mapping and forecasting in public health. I am opinionated about reproducible workflows, and enjoy teaching programming in R. 

Since finishing my PhD, I have invested in a new bike and many new books. When I'm not dancing around and debugging code at my desk you can find me curled up reading about revolutions around the world, or on the trail.
